## Describe the steps that were taken in your HTML file to make your webpage more accessible:

There were multiple steps taken to make this webpage more accessible for my clients' audience. Starting from the title of the webpage (which appears as the tab description in your browser), this was renamed to "Horiseon Home Page" to describe what the viewer would be looking at when they clicked on the URL for this webpage. 

Next, in the website's header, the "seo" span element within the Horiseon now appears more visible to the viewer after changing the color to contrast more with the background. 

After that, the proper id was added to the "search engine optimization" link so that when the user clicks on the button, it will bring them to the correct content section for that link. 

Finally, all of the pictures displayed in the main section, as well as the aside column of the webpage, have alt attributes that adequately describe what the image is showing in case of page breaks and for accessibility purposes. 

## This is what my final Horiseon webpage looks like:
